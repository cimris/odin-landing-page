Landing Page Project from The Odin Project

This project is based on the specifications from "Project: Landing Page" by The Odin Project.

The main goals of this project, for my learning, is to properly implement HTML and CSS to create a site similar to the design documents. I found I had a rough understanding of CSS Flexbox for the Google Homepage assignment, overused ID's, and really had a scatter approach to my planning and design. For this project I wish to walk away with a better understanding of Flexbox, better use of classes in CSS styling, and take a more meticulous and structured approach to the site design. It is unlikely that I will worry about multiple devices, however, I hope that if I take a proper approach to the initial design it is something I can implement with relative ease later on.

_Work History_

12/09/21 Project start. Began with the header content, the nav bar, and the "catch" text and imaging. Was able to roughly place everything on the page today and will now work on fine tuning all the positioning. I am understanding how to use flexbox a lot better than I was with the Google Homepage Project.
