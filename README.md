Landing Page Project from The Odin Project

This project is based on the specifications from "Project: Landing Page" by The Odin Project.

The main goals of this project, for my learning, is to properly implement HTML and CSS to create a site similar to the design documents. I found I had a rough understanding of CSS Flexbox for the Google Homepage assignment, overused ID's, and really had a scatter approach to my planning and design. For this project I wish to walk away with a better understanding of Flexbox, better use of classes in CSS styling, and take a more meticulous and structured approach to the site design. It is unlikely that I will worry about multiple devices, however, I hope that if I take a proper approach to the initial design it is something I can implement with relative ease later on.

_Work History_

12/09/21 Project start. Began with the header content, the nav bar, and the "catch" text and imaging. Was able to roughly place everything on the page today and will now work on fine tuning all the positioning. I am understanding how to use flexbox a lot better than I was with the Google Homepage Project.

13/09/21 A remarkably productive day. I could have finished the first version of the site today, however, I am getting called away by work. My understanding of how Flexbox works is massively better than before. I find it a breeze to position elements. The only thing I may want to do is to make some elements more static on the page for this project as my goal wasn't to make the page re-sizable for every single viewport. Perhaps using CSS Grid would have been better, but hey, it works. This is the first time I have really began to feel in control of a project. Guess I am learning after all!

I did take a moment during work - may as well - to come back and finish all the inital positioning. Now just to figure out all the quirks, and then maybe take some more time to style this a bit differently than the project specifications.

14/09/21 Initial project done! I went off and had fun with it, completely changing the styling from the default project, but I more or less followed the specs asked for. There are still maybe one or two little things with Flexbox that mess me up sometimes but I feel much more competent than I did before. I am sure with further practice I will continue to improve as well!

_Note_
I did not test this on multiple devices and all different viewport dimensions. I did, however, make sure it was basically usable. I realise there is a lot more to be done when accounting for different viewports and devices that would require me to also become more comfortable using CSS Grid, however, I felt that was a bit outside the asked for scope of this project.
